document.Document.java
document.BasicDocument.java
document.EfficientDocument.java

This graph just show the difference of speed efficiency of a text (warAndPeace.txt) been analyzing its Flesch readability score using document.EfficientDocument.java vs document.BasicDocument.java. 100 points were used.
